        <text>Step Across Space and Call Creatures from Thin Air

You consider distance and matter to be flexible guidelines rather than physical laws. Conjurers harness the power of magic that moves creatures instantly through space and summons creatures to fight on their behalf.

You explore the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As a Necromancer, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all creatures. As you progress, you learn to use magic to drain the life force from a creature and transform its vital energy into magical power. Many see Necromancers as menacing or villainous, though not all Necromancers are evil. Nevertheless, the manipulation of life and death is considered taboo in many societies.

Bolster Undead. As a Bonus Action, choose any number of Undead you have created or summoned with a Necromancy spell that are within 60 feet of you.

You study spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.
	Some Transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.

DESIGN NOTE: TRANSMUTER UPDATES
Here are the main updates in this subclass since its appearance in the 2014 Player's Handbook:

	• Transmutation Savant now gives you free Transmutation spells to add to your spellbook.

	• Transmuter's Stone is now available at a lower level. You create the stone when you finish a Long Rest.

	• Wondrous Enhancement and Split Transmutation are new features.

	• Potent Stone is a new feature that gives you more options with your transmuter's stone.

	• Master Transmuter is revised; its Panacea choice now restores Hit Points and can remove a curse.
