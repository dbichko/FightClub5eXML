  <description>We've revised our grimoires and are ready for you to explore our suite of Arcane Subclasses. This document presents six revised subclasses for the Fighter (Arcane Archer), the Monk (Tattooed Warrior), and the Wizard (Conjurer, Enchanter, Necromancer, and Transmuter). The material uses the rules in the Player's Handbook.

This Is Playtest Content
The material in Unearthed Arcana is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. The options here are experemental and in draft form, usable in your D&amp;D campaign but not refined by final game development. They are not officially part of the game. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;D Adventurers League events. Your feedback will help determine whether we adopt it as official.</description>
