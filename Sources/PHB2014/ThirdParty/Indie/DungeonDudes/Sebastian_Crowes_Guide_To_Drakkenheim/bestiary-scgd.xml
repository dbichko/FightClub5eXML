    <description>Not all mageborn are cut out for the rules, regulations, and intense study and practice required by the Amethyst Academy, and some do not make it through their schooling. An outcast may still be under the guidance of the Academy, performing field work or odd jobs that require a more hands on approach. Oftentimes these outcasts dabble in dangerous magics, and have far less caution, and far too much confidence for the Academy's liking.

1 The target takes 6d12 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

2 The target takes 6d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

3 The target takes 6d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

4 The target takes 6d12 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

5 The target takes 6d12 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

6 At the start of each of its turns, the affected target uses all its movement to move directly towards the closest creature it can see. Then, the affected target uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the affected target does nothing this turn. At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

7 At the start of each of its turns, the affected target gains 1 level of contamination. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

8 The target is struck by an additional ray. Roll on this table twice more. There's no limit to how many additional rays can strike a single creature in this manner.</text>

    <description>This extremely withdrawn Academy Director dwells on the moon. Although they typically interact with mortals in the guise of a human wizard, Amaranthyst is in fact an ancient delerium dragon. Indeed, the dragon's unique complexion of crystalline purple scales and gemstone-like features is the namesake of the Amethyst Academy itself.

Personality Trait. How do you know if you are the dreamer, or merely the dream? I speak in absurd paradox, asking mortals vexing questions to which they cannot answer within their limited reference frame.

Ideal. A single grain of sand makes no sound upon falling, but a million grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something. That is the nature of magic.

Bond. Mortals believe they can comprehend the fundamental forces of the universe, but they are gravely mistaken. If I know one thing, it is that even I know nothing.

Flaw. I find the fixed nature of the mortal world deeply strange. It is for the best that this world is unravelled by delerium, for chaos will only improve it.

Amaranthyst is order out of chaos incarnate. Aeons ago, the dragon entered the mortal plane from the Space Between Worlds, and has aided mortal mages out of curiosity and amusement. They have long sought to understand the unknowable properties of the strange dimension where it sprung into existence, and has spent millennia wandering that unfathomable place. Amaranthyst has long known about the secret properties of delerium, and views the crystals as merely the fundamental building block of reality itself. To them, the crystals are transforming the world into something wondrous, and he does not understand why mortals would fear it.

    <description>Riding throughout the jungles of Terene atop great Clawstrider Raptors or other giant lizards, the Rangers are skilled at guerrilla tactics and mounted combat, often wearing camouflaged leather armor reinforced with jungle leaves and hardwoods. The Clawstriders are a fearsome and stealthy force. If you see a lone ranger in the jungles, you are already surrounded.

    <description>These strange arachnid-like creatures seem to weave together partial realities, parallel dimensions, and alternate timelines like a spider spinning its web. They have features that resemble that of a large spider, but their twisted forms, elongated torso, fanged maws, and spiny hides give them an otherworldly guise that makes them hard to distinguish as anything from this plane of existence. Those who have faced one have commented on the broken sense of reality that occurs when attempting to attack an eldritch crawler.

    <description>This floating mass of wet flabby flesh drifts through the air, its many long spindly tendrils dangling down like some form of incomprehensible jellyfish. Oftentimes these creatures appear in strange hues of pale pinks, purples, and whites. Their large eye placed in the middle of their fleshy mass glows with octarine hues and their gaze weakens the body and mind. The soft sound of thrumming and suckling follows them as insane chattering of unknown languages murmur in the minds of those unfortunate enough to behold these creatures that drift through the thin places into our world.

Floating inches above the ground, its hands out to either side as shifting motes of otherworldly energy float amongst its long, gnarled fingers.

Chittering whispers and slurping chorused mumbles of maddening truths and unfathomable realities echo in the minds of those who bear witness to this mastermind of the space between worlds.

    <description>Although the term "ranger" has often been used to describe lone hunters on the fringes of society, or great groups of warriors from the jungles and forests, the Hooded Lanterns are renowned for their mastery of urban environments, military strategy, and skilled marksmanship. The talents and accuracy of the Hooded Lanterns has allowed them to survive and maintain a foothold in the ruins of Drakkenheim, arguably the most dangerous environment in the entire continent.

    <description>Many nobles of the great nations of the continent lead their own soldiers into battle, or set out on heroic adventures and diplomatic missions. Especially in the lands of Caspia, princes and princesses are more often than not trained and skilled combatants, looking to make their mark as a scion of their house.

It ripples with black voidlike hues and splashes of deep purples and blues as if its flesh was a moving image of the cosmos.

At the start of each of the maw vermin's turns, any creature inside its maw takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and must succeed on a DC 15 constitution saving throw or suffer one Contamination Level.

The maw vermin's mouth can hold up to three creatures at a time. If the maw vermin takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the maw vermin must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the maw vermin. If the maw vermin dies, any swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

    <description>The maw vermin may have been a rat that fed on too much delerium, or perhaps the sickly scavengers of another dimension altogether. Its pink flesh is caked with thick patchwork tufts of fur, with three gangly long arms that end in long bony fingers with talon like claws. Rather than a head, the top of its massive body has two beady rodent-like eyes and rat-like features. Upon its belly is a large gaping maw filled with jagged teeth and a massive purple tongue slurping and slathering gobs of vile saliva out of it as it drags itself towards its next meal.

    <description>Many of the northern warriors have adopted the title "reaver". Donned in animal furs, wielding axes, and painting themselves with blood, these brutal warriors rage in to battle with an unrelenting ferocity. Many reavers believe they are closely tied to nature, the elements, and the wild animals of the places they inhabit. Whether it be the Netherwind Reavers, or the Northfolk from Skye, these terrifying warriors are infamous for their brutality.

    <description>Inherited Silver:

Rickard Steelfang's unique curse means that normal silvered weapons are not effective against him. Instead, the weapon must be made specifically from silver that was passed down to the wielder from a now-deceased friend or family member. The weapon need not be in the original form the silver was inherited in. For example, a character could make silver arrowheads or crossbow bolts by melting down a silver locket given to them by their grandmother.

    <description>The knights of the Silver Order are world renowned as the defenders of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Taking on holy quests and religious missions for the Divine Matriarch, these holy knights have been known to ride griffons into battle, or march forth in force armed with plate mail, swords, and shields, and divine magic to bolster their combat prowess. To some, these paladins have a reputation of being divine protectors, noble warriors, and divine symbols of the Faith. To others, they are a terrifying and ugly example of the power of the Sacred Flame.

    <description>This horrific monstrosity is larger than a whale. It has a long, serpentine body bristling with sleek fins, undulating barbed tentacles, and rubbery purple-black flesh. It writhes through the waves with unearthly grace despite its bulk, and seeping from the flaps and vents within its skin come secretions of a thick, oozing oil which shimmers with prismatic hues. The monstrosity has a gigantic fanged maw which it holds agape. Seaweed, fish entrails, and slime dribble from between its sharp teeth, and its bulbous eyes glow with octarine light. It has adorned its brow with fishing nets, coral, sea debris, and delerium crystals, as if wearing a coronet and jewelry. As you look upon its form, you feel a slight headache, a buzzing in your ear, and a pressing in your chest; as if the psychic presence of this otherworldly creature has conjured up the crushing pressure of the abyssal depths.
	The Duchess is a contaminated sea monster that haunts the shores of Ash Bay (see Appendix A: Monsters for its game statistics and those of its minions). The creature originally made its home in the sewer cisterns of Drakkenheim. However, as the Duchess matured and grew larger, it departed the cursed city via the Drann River in search of more plentiful prey and fresh thralls, bringing a new wave of contamination to Ash Bay. It deliberately destroyed the Empress Geraldine just off the coast of Drannsmund; the merchant vessel was transporting a vast hoard of delerium to the far continent. The Duchess has slowly tended the new reef of delerium coral flourishing around the shipwreck, transforming it into a personal underwater palace.

	• Personality Trait. "What horrific condition afflicts the land-dwellers! How awful must it be that you cannot live and languish in the wonderful sea... such a terrible curse which keeps you bound to the land..."

	• Ideal. "My magic will weaken the curse which holds you to the land, so you might swim through the waves of my court, and be welcomed as one of my loyal subjects! Perhaps you will be worthy enough to become one of my valiant Knights!"

	• Bond. "Come see the wondrous treasures of my Grotto! Gaze upon the opalescent, prismatic beauty of my prized coral... you may hold it in your hands, for a while, if you wish...

	• Flaw. "I abhor the land, and will never set scale or fin upon it." The Duchess has powerful and otherworldly psychic powers.

They can communicate telepathically, read the thoughts of mortals, and turn mortals into its contaminated thralls. It makes deceptive offers that appeal to characters' deepest desires, manipulating them into embracing contamination. Those under its control slowly mutate, taking on horrific aquatic features.
	The Duchess has seized control over the population of Ashshaffen, where it summons its worshipers at the Salt Cove Shrine, an underground cavern beneath the ruined chapel in town. The monster is now slowly spreading its tendrils of influence over Drannsmund.
	Meanwhile, the creature has dispatched one of its more capable thralls to the Starwatch Lighthouse. There, the Duchess hopes to open a dimensional rift so she can conjure other beings like itself, styling itself no longer as a duchess — but an empress.

    <description>This eldritch spell summons a manifestation of the Thing with the Writhing Tail, a mysterious entity with a vaguely feline form which dwells in the Space Between Worlds. Perhaps it is the favoured cat of Phantasia, or a fragment of Shegorach, but to others, it is simply known by the odd name "Bruce".

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

    <description>Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.
	An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

    <description>The leader of the Hooded Lanterns is Lord Commander Elias Drexel. He is a large, gruff man in his early fifties. He is well-built and imposing, with a grim frown on his wide, angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick mustache, side chops, and a mane of long braided brown hair. He is often garbed in chainmail with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons, upon which is firmly clasped the Lord Commander's Badge.

	• Personality Trait. I seldom take time for niceties and pleasantries. I prefer people to be direct and to the point.

	• Ideal. I am loyal to my soldiers and expect the same in return. I do not often trust outsiders, but if they show their worth, I will treat them like my own.

	• Bond. My past is wrought with bloodshed and loss; and I feel intense guilt for every warrior who has died under my command. I seek redemption by staying true to what the Hooded Lanterns represent.

	• Flaw. I avoid talking about my past failures, and if it comes up I am quick to anger.

Elias Drexel leads the Hooded Lanterns' mission to reclaim Drakkenheim and uncover a worthy successor to the throne of Westemär. He would love to have the financial support of House von Baden, but has a complicated relationship with Ludwig von Fritz, as the two were bitter foes during the Civil War. The Lord Commander receives moderate support from House Kleinkessel and the rulers of Geldstadt and Altbruke in his mission.
	The Lord Commander orchestrated the original failed incursions into Drakkenheim before the Civil War broke out, and during the war itself, he fought for Mannfred von Kessel. However, when Mannfred made it clear he no longer intended to retake Drakkenheim after the war, Elias Drexel secretly seethed over the lives lost there in vain. The Lord Commander joined the plot to assassinate Mannfred and his heirs, but did not expect Cecilia von Kessel to die soon after. Now, Drexel believes strongly it is his duty to make amends for the mistakes he caused. At the time he believed he was doing the right thing, but since the apparent end of the von Kessel line, he was left with nothing to fight for. The Hooded Lanterns represent a new purpose for Drexel, and a way to right the wrongs of his past.


Hooded Lantern Ranger:
Although the term "ranger" has often been used to describe lone hunters on the fringes of society, or great groups of warriors from the jungles and forests, the Hooded Lanterns are renowned for their mastery of urban environments, military strategy, and skilled marksmanship. The talents and accuracy of the Hooded Lanterns has allowed them to survive and maintain a foothold in the ruins of Drakkenheim, arguably the most dangerous environment in the entire continent.

    <description>A finely-dressed male human liege, Duke von Baden is a stately man in his mid-forties. After spending his youth adventuring among pirates in the Middle Sea, Valentin took up the mantle of the Duke of Drannsmund when his father and elder brother were slain in the early attempts to reclaim Drakkenheim. Now a shrewd admiral and diplomat, Duke von Baden chose discretion during the Civil War, remaining neutral throughout the conflict despite repeated entreaties from both sides of House von Kessel.

	• Personality Trait. I conduct myself with professional savvy and charm, addressing others with their formal titles and proper names. I pepper my speech with nautical references and naval terminology.

	• Ideal. A good business sense, fair exchange, and mutual profit set the sails for a good relationship, whether in life, love, or politics.

	• Bond. I must be a safe harbor to my city, its ships, and its people. Under my leadership, I will shelter them from the storm facing our times.

	• Flaw. Just as one must sail carefully on uncharted waters, one should regard new allies and situations carefully. It is better to remain distant and impartial, keeping along shallow waters, lest you become caught up in an unseen tempest far from shore.

Duke von Baden now wrestles heavily on whether or not he should forbid the trade and export of delerium within his city. However, that could compromise his ambitions. Since he remained staunchly neutral during the Civil War, he has cold relationships with the other dukes and nobles. Valentin increasingly believes Drannsmund is best positioned as an independent city-state: a northern rival to the independent Liberio.

Liege:
Many nobles of the great nations of the continent lead their own soldiers into battle, or set out on heroic adventures and diplomatic missions. Especially in the lands of Caspia, princes and princesses are more often than not trained and skilled combatants, looking to make their mark as a scion of their house.

    <description>The presumptive heir to House von Baden, Verona von Baden is a cunning human spy with many connections spread throughout Westemär. She is an athletic woman in her early twenties with wide brown eyes, tightly curled black hair, and soft features. She is known as having a good eye for money and is well-versed in politics and trade. She is responsible for many of the diplomatic arrangements, political discussions, and negotiations with other cities and rulers. Verona von Baden is often dressed in a white button up with a brown leather vest, dark trousers, and swashbuckling boots. She carries a shimmering rapier with an ornate golden hilt with an engraving of her family crest upon it. Like her father, she is an avid sailor and ship captain. Her own caravel is known as the Rose of Thorns, a ship built from rosewood with an ornate carved bouquet as its figurehead, white sails, and armed with canons. She has been at the helm of many sea battles, and her swift ship is known and feared by many.

	• Personality Trait. I am a careful listener and observer, knowing what to say to make people around me feel at ease, and get what I need out of them. Kindness is a master manipulator.

	• Ideal. Money can't buy you happiness, but the more of it you have, the less you need to worry. Having strong allies and good cash flow is the recipe for a happy life.

	• Bond. I am the best negotiator and smartest leader this city has ever had, and will prove myself invaluable to the people and my father.

	• Flaw. My overconfidence and desire to do things myself has seen me in over my head on multiple occasions, whether it be with a pirate's sword to my throat, a political debate, or captured by otherworldly monsters.

Verona Von Baden has positioned herself as an incredible leader, both in naval expeditions and battles, but also in political debates and trade. She hopes to not only claim the duchy of Drannsmund after her father steps down, but prove to the people of the city her value as their leader. In doing so, she believes that if no successor is found to rule Westemär, her connections and alliances will ensure she will be the most obvious choice.

Spy:
Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.

    <description>The current head of the household is Duke Ludwig von Fritz, a cantankerous and covetous noble miser. The decrepit man is suffering from long-term delerium contamination, made worse by his reliance on an utter quack of a doctor who uses the duke to test his own tinctures.

	• Personality Trait. I don't care for pleasantries and care even less for appearances, even my own. I speak openly about my thoughts, and can't resist the opportunity to belittle others' deeds.

	• Ideal. I am tremendously pleased that the Civil War ultimately destroyed House von Kessel. Now, I can carve out the Marshlands as a petty kingdom of my own.

	• Bond. I seethe over the destruction wrought upon Todesfeld as a result of the Civil War — not because of what has happened to the people of the city, mind you, but what it has done to my fortune ever since.

	• Flaw. There is nothing anyone can do to earn my respect or admiration other than money and power.

Duke von Fritz's wife died several years ago of delerium contamination after the Todesfeld Dam broke. His eight children run their own estates, preferring to have as little contact as possible with their father. He eagerly took arms against Mannfred von Kessel during the Civil War. He eyes the port of Drannsmund and the city of Leuchten, and has begun eagerly purchasing weapons and armor from the Amethyst Academy hoping to increase his military prowess.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

	While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
	While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</text>

Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point.

    <description>Today, the ruler of House Kleinkessel is Countess Constance Kleinkessel. She is secretly a vampire. Constance Kleinkessel is a voluptuous woman who appears in her late forties. She has gleaming emerald eyes, crimson red lips, a flushed round face, and a small pointed nose. Her jet-black hair is tied up into braids and woven into an intricate headpiece set with pearls. She wears a scarlet gown and is dripping with jewelry. Her painted fingernails are sharpened into points. She often meets guests for dinner, where she licks her lips and runs her fingers on the edge of a cup of red wine.

	• Personality Trait. I could eat you up. I fill my speech with macabre innuendo which mix dining, physical intimacy, and slaughter.

	• Ideal. The living must be made to serve the dead. When my plans come to fruition, mortals will be divided into cattle and corpses.

	• Bond. I am bound by bonds of blood to serve dark masters and vampiric overlords, but one day I will take it all for myself.

	• Flaw. I can't ever resist a good meal... would you like to stay for dinner?
Constance Kleinkessel herself is in fact the sister of Helena I.

Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues.
	During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development: she had been planning to target Cecelia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär.
	Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel has also worked closely with her doctor, the malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors, to experiment with new ways delerium can create augmented vampires.


Vampire:
Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.

Dark Desires. Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.

Born from Death. Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.

Chained to the Grave. Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.

Undead Nature. Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.

    <description>Rickard Steelfang is a unique human lycanthrope whose curse renders him almost unkillable.
	Rickard is a massive man standing nearly 7 feet tall with broad tree trunk arms, a barrel chest, and a large potbelly. He has a mane of long, red, unkempt hair with a beard to match. He wears animal furs and a thick brown leather belt that holds up several daggers and two large axes. He speaks in a loud, boisterous, grizzled voice, and cares little for manners or etiquette. He swears and spits when he talks, and speaks his mind to just about everyone.

	• Personality Trait. I'll tell you how it is and then some. Don't expect honeyed words and a helping hand from me. You're more likely to get a swift insult and an axe in the back.

	• Ideal. Life is what you make of it. You gotta do the best with what you're given, and if you're good at something, never do it for free.

	• Bond. All of my pack are cursed and these folks can never go home again. The least I can do for 'em is give them purpose and pay to make their cursed lives worth a damn.

	• Flaw. I'm uncouth and vulgar to a point where most everyone I meet wishes they hadn't.

A ruthless warrior, his curse has caused him a life of bloodshed that he never wanted, but he has made the most of his situation and given up on fighting what he is, embracing his animal side fully. However, as the years march on, he has grown weary and considers searching for the means to break his lycanthropic curse.

Werewolf:
A werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tendency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far-a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.
	Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.

Lycanthropes:
One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.
	Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.

Curse of Lycanthropy: A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A remove curse spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.
	A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.
	Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.

      <name>A Green Dragon's Lair</name>
      <text>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.
	At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</text>
    </legendary>
    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Lair Actions</name>
      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

	• A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

	• Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.</text>

    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

	• Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the 'thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.

	• Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. 	• Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.

	• Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.

If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</text>

      <name>Green Dragon Lairs</name>
      <text>Green dragons prefer making their lairs in verdant places—jungles, bayous, pine forests, or anywhere with abundant vegetation that they can shape according to their desires. An older green dragon might indulge in horticulture, cultivating the local flora as befits their individual aesthetic. However, most green dragons are content to either excavate beneath trees and nestle among the roots or make lairs inside trees large enough to be hollowed out without compromising their structure.
	Green dragons take great interest in woodland settlements when seeking lair sites. Though they are fully capable of modifying forests to their own liking, they find it easier and vastly more entertaining to take something belonging to smaller and weaker beings.

      <name>Additional Lair Actions</name>
      <text>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

	• Creeper Vines: The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become zombies (see their entry in the Monster Manual). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.

	• Lashing Root: One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

      <name>Additional Regional Effects</name>
      <text>Either or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the Monster Manual:

	• Inviting Whispers: Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.

	• Twisted Messengers: The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature's throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon's own in order to allow the dragon's voice to issue forth.

      <name>Green Dragon Treasures</name>
      <text>Green dragons relish gems and jewelry whose palettes reflect their chosen forest environments, favoring viridescent colors and bursts of floral brilliance. Many develop vast collections of emeralds and beryls as a result, punctuated by amber, red rubies, tiger's eyes, bismuth, and the like. They likewise covet finely crafted items and works of art depicting unspoiled nature.
	Unlike many of their kin, green dragons use the transformative power of nature to turn those valuables into truly unique treasures. By wrapping and threading treasures with rare vegetation and carefully applying their own skill as gardeners, green dragons meld nature and artifice into new masterpieces. This can lead to complications for would-be treasure hunters, as green dragons take enormous pride in their handiwork—so much so that intruders damaging the delicate arrangements of flower and vine that surround a treasure cache might come under attack before even touching any of the hoard's contents.

    </legendary>
    <description>This adult green dragon dwelling in the Achtungwald is an elusive creature who has occupied the deepest and darkest center of the woods for hundreds of years. Trethysia narrowly avoided being drawn into the wars of House von Drakken, and has skillfully escaped countless Caspian dragonslayers. The dragon is a capable illusionist and can tap into the primal energies of the forest, and uses these powers to deceive and trick their foes and hunters. Now, they are quite content to live in solitude. There is an ancient ruined elven village in the heart of the forest that is said to be the dragon's home now, but from time to time the dragon is seen flying over the forests on raids, snatching livestock from the smaller farmsteads. However, Trethysia generally avoids direct confrontation with humans.
	Still, many a campfire story tells of the great elven treasures the dragon hoards inside those ancient ruins, and there are still those who remember Trethysia's treachery on the outskirts of Schaffburg, or the damage they did to the walls of Altbruke.

Adult Green Dragon:
The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.
	A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.
	A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.
	A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.

Capricious Hunters: A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.
	Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.
	A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

Manipulative Schemers: A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires.	Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.
	When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.

Conflict and Corruption: Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watchsometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.
	Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, ores, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.

Living Treasures: A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

	• Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	• A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

	• Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</text>

      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>The region containing a legendary red dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

	• Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.

	• Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.

	• Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

      <name>Red Dragon Lairs</name>
      <text>Red dragons lair in mountain badlands and high, isolated peaks and hills, preferring warm caverns in the rocky depths beneath those landscapes. Lairs with natural geothermal or lava vents are highly sought after, as these features create an environment ideally suited to the dragons' taste.
	Minions often attend red dragons in their lairs. These servants keep the place swept clean of refuse and watch out for intruders, while providing the imperious dragon with subjects to bully and command. Some minions worship the dragon and serve willingly, but others would escape if they could.

      <name>Additional Lair Actions</name>
      <text>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) red dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

	• Noxious Smoke: A cloud of thick, dark smoke fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature other than the dragon that starts its turn in the cloud or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. The cloud lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

	• Searing Heat: Searing heat spreads out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature that enters the affected area or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The heat lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

	• Desertification: Precipitation is almost nonexistent within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, making the land parched and arid and most plant life withered and brown.

	• Fiery Senses: The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any open flame within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.

	• Ominous Flames: Open flames within 6 miles of the dragon's lair are tinged dark red, hiss and crackle constantly, and throw off embers and showers of sparks.

      <name>Red Dragon Treasures</name>
      <text>Red dragons love gold above all other precious metals and are entranced by its gleam, its luster, and the sound of its chime. They amass gold coins and objects to form the bulk of their hoards, along with red and fiery gemstones such as rubies and fire opals. Red dragons favor items made of metal and stone, which can survive the test of time. Many such items in an ancient red dragon's hoard might be hundreds or thousands of years old. They tend to eschew treasures that burn, such as leather, paper, and cloth items.
	For a red dragon, every treasure is a mark of pride and a personal trophy. Like a proud hunter, a red dragon relishes telling the tale of acquiring each individual relic or coin, glorifying the dragon's own deeds.

Red Dragon Art Objects:

1 | A hammered metal brazier elaborately etched and set with polished obsidian, which sits atop a stand holding rare incense blends
2 | A beautifully inlaid mosaic map of the region within a 100-mile radius of the dragon's lair

6 | A statue of the red dragon with gemstones for eyes
7 | A detailed, life-sized elf skull cast in precious metal
8 | A game board and a complete set of pieces, all carved and inlaid with precious and semiprecious stones (the dragon is fond of playing the game but has few worthy opponents)
9 | A fist-sized gemstone carved into a likeness of the dragon's head
10 | A set of precious metal tablets containing ancient lore
11 | A beautifully wrought crown set with fiery gemstones, possibly the legacy of a lost empire
12 | A beautiful polished sphere of rainbow obsidian, set on a wrought-gold stand

    </legendary>
    <description>This ancient red dragon resides in the caldera of the Dragon's Maw. The dragon has lived here since before recorded history, and spends decades at a time slumbering.
	Vulmungoth rarely stirs in their lair. The caldera is so inhospitable, most would-be dragon slayers die scaling the volcano. Still, they emerge every century or so to slake their vast appetite, flying down into Elyria to consume mortals and their livestock. Their waking always follows great eruptions from the Dragon's Maw, and many towns and villages are destroyed. Thus, the locals living south of the Drakeclaws grow up with well-made plans for their evacuation and escape should the dragon return. During their last rampage, the dragon descended upon Holy Lumen in a horrible encounter that almost saw Saint Tarna's Cathedral destroyed.
	Vulmungoth is the last surviving dragon who was a part of the ancient Blood Pact, where the sorcerer-kings melded their bloodlines with draconic magic. Today many sorcerers and dragonborn can trace their distant ancestry to Vulmungoth.
	Shortly after the fall of the sorcerer-kings, a group of monks of the Sacred Flame attempted to ascend the Dragon's Maw and destroy Vulmungoth for their ties to the Arcane Empire. The dragon devoured most of them. Only a small handful of monks made it off the mountains. The resounding defeat ended the organized attempts by Elyria to defeat the Doom of the Mountain.

Ancient Red Dragon:
The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.
	The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.
	The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.

Mountain Masters: Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hilldwelling copper dragons from time to time.

Arrogant Tyrants: Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.
	No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.

Status and Slaves: Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.
	When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.

Obsessive Collectors: Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.
	A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

    <description>Floating gemstones orbit about the head of this ancient and wispy elf archmage; their magic has sustained him for thousands of years. Valtar Banemoon is the hermetic lighthouse keeper, and has not left the lighthouse in millennia. He knows little of the world beyond, and even less about how he got here.

	• Personality Trait. I haven't spoken to anyone in... well, ever. If I got the chance, I would love to know everything about them and their world.

	• Ideal. I remember a time when many elves were here, and have dim visions of them passing through a faery-gate, anguished and tired, refugees from an unknown cataclysm which destroyed our world. I know not what has happened to them, but I hope beyond hope they are safe and thriving

	• Bond. I was charged to protect and guard this place, but why I cannot recall.... What was lost, that wondrous place... Acadia. The name is the only thing I can remember, and I hold on to that memory dearly.

	• Flaw. The pang of missing memory is palpable. I struggle to remember anything.

Valtar Banemoon has never had any visitors, and is uneasy about leaving his post. He knows that he was born on another world and traveled to this earth, but remembers nothing else of that time. If convinced to leave the lighthouse and enter the world, though, perhaps it may be possible to unlock his memory and learn the great mystery of the elven people.

Archmage:
Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.
	An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

The wizened dragonborn has a wispy white beard and wrinkled face. He wears uniquely-crafted spectacles and flowing purple robes.

Mage:
Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.

    <description>Leuchten
Capital of the Gap
Population: Approximately 10,000 people
Ruler: Baron Boris the Bold, a human knight
Civil War Allegiance: Cecilia von Kessel
Known For: Impressive Fortifications, Siege Workshops

A great fortress-city rises up in the flat valley flanked by the Drakeclare Mountains to the west and the Glimmer Mountains to the east. Leuchten stands as a bastion against the armies of the south. Imposing walls of stone and round towers bristling with guns and cannons are layered atop jagged wedge-shaped earthworks. A deep black moat surrounds the city, the only entrance via two longspanning drawbridges at the north and south ends.

Leuchten defends the important land route connecting Westemär to the southern nations. Inside the city proper are all manner of arsenals, stockpiles, workshops, and barracks.
	Naturally, the city has faced more sieges over its history than perhaps any other city on the continent, and certainly within Westemär. Despite its impressive defenses, it has fallen twice — though never to a direct assault. When Albrecht von Drakken died in battle amidst his failed invasion of Caspia, the Scalebreakers broke against the walls and guns of Leuchten in their retaliatory attack. During the Mage Wars, the city was briefly captured thanks to a forged document, and fell again thanks to adventurous mercenaries during a minor conflict between Westemär and Liberio.
	Given the strategic importance of Leuchten, the city does not have an ancestral noble house as its traditional ruler. Rather, the monarchs of Westemär have typically assigned title and authority to one of their top military figures, or, as is more often the case, a problematic royal sibling who needs a distant but seemingly important assignment far away from the politics of the capital. It was previously under the rule of Cecilia von Kessel, but since her death the city is now controlled by her former general, Baron Boris the Bold.

Knight:
Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.

    <description>Gloria is a young Silver Order paladin who made the rank of Knight-Captain early in her career, and has been a strong leader since. She has long blonde hair often worn in a tight ponytail and narrowed green eyes. Her round face and pleasant demeanor give her an air of kindness that can be disarming to many at first, but the kind exterior hides her cunning and strength that comes out any time she speaks.

	• Personality Trait. I do my best to be welcoming and kind to those 1 speak with, but I speak loud and firmly to hold the attention of those around me and I know how to command a room.

	• Ideal. It is our duty as knights of the Silver Order to uphold the tenets of our faith and help those in need. We go where we must and do everything we can to spark the Sacred Flame in the hearts of those we aid.

	• Bond. The world can be a dark place, and I joined the Silver Order to help bring a little more light into it. It is my sworn duty to provide a light to those wandering the darkness, and help them find their way.

	• Flaw. I assume the best in everyone, and believe that everyone has good in them.

Gloria is extremely proud of her position as KnightCaptain and wants very much to give the Silver Order a good reputation amongst those devout to the Sacred Flame, but even more importantly, those who are not. She sees good deeds, acts of kindness, and helping those in need as an important job for the Silver Order as every person they help is more likely to look to the Silver Order with kind regards, and in turn, become more open to the ideals of the Sacred Flame.

Silver Order Paladin:
The knights of the Silver Order are world renowned as the defenders of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Taking on holy quests and religious missions for the Divine Matriarch, these holy knights have been known to ride griffons into battle, or march forth in force armed with plate mail, swords, and shields, and divine magic to bolster their combat prowess. To some, these paladins have a reputation of being divine protectors, noble warriors, and divine symbols of the Faith. To others, they are a terrifying and ugly example of the power of the Sacred Flame.

	• The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage.

    <description>Xel'vohca the Ancient is one of the eight Amethyst Academy Directors, and the Archmage of Elyria. The Academy Director Lich has held his position since the Amethyst Academy was founded, and was among the principal architects of the Edicts of Lumen. Indeed, since the time the Edicts were being drafted, the Divine Matriarchs have known about his undead nature, though they must tolerate this uncomfortable truth under the terms of the agreement.
	Even still, Xel' vocha's undead nature is not immediately apparent; aside from the High Paladin and the Divine Matriarch, the other members of the Elyrian Cabinet are not aware Xel'vohca is a lich. Upon first meeting he appears as an old man in an ornate wheelchair of strange metal, attended by his personal shield guardian. He has drooping jowls, sallow skin, sunken octarine eyes, wispy white hair, and an expression of deep sadness upon his face. He wears a simple purple robe and carries a glass-encased delerium orb. Except to incant his magic, Xel'vohca no longer speaks and relies on telepathy to communicate.

	• Personality Trait. I communicate telepathically in strained and long-winded streams of consciousness, my mind constantly burdened with centuries of thoughts.

	• Ideal. Magic can do great things. Terrible things, but great things indeed. We must wield it with responsibility, but wield it we must.

	• Bond. I was there when the first warlocks made their ancient pacts. The burden of the original sin of magic rests upon me, and I will steward the inheritors of the arcane until the last sun goes out at the end of eternity. I think of all mages as my children, and the sorcerer-kings were my wayward sons and daughters. I cannot repeat those mistakes.

	• Flaw. Though my undead heart no longer beats, it pains me to feed my phylactery and sustain myself. The memories of these stolen souls haunts me, so I only do so rarely. As a result, my body has greatly atrophied, and now I fear my mind is slipping into madness as well.

Xel'vohca was both the first warlock and the first lich. Far from an evil creature, Xel'vohca has spent thousands of years facing the consequences of the choices he made in life. He is older than recorded history, and was vizier to many of the sorcerer-kings, though he was unable to stop their tyranny. His existence has often been spent trying to make amends for the failures of his past, but this task grows ever harder as new conflicts arise. The destruction of Drakkenheim and the

Lich:
Liches are the remains of great wizards who embrace undeath as a means of preserving themselves. They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.
	A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.

Secrets of Undeath: No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.
	A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.
	With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.

Soul Sacrifices: A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the imprisonment spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.
	A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.

Death and Restoration: When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.
	Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.

Lonely Existence: From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.
	Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.

Magic Collectors: Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.

Undead Nature: A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Lord Regent Polonius Reed is the most prominent figure amongst the Elyrian nobility, and sits at the head of the Parliament of Lords. Though a distant second to the authority and influence of the Divine Matriarch, he nonetheless holds much sway over the military and economic decisions of the nation.
	Polonius is a burly man in his early sixties. The noble has a round, full face with a thick beard and short black hair combed over his balding head. His shaggy eyebrows highlight his deep-set, dark brown eyes. He dresses in exquisite silk Elyrian jackets, complete with a frilled ruff, puffed sleeves, and gold filigree. He is a clever and persistent man who carries himself with an air of importance.

	• Personality Trait. I relish in a good heated discussion. I find the skills of diplomacy and debate are best honed with an oldfashioned argument.

	• Ideal. I can argue any point convincingly, regardless of its truth. Feelings are more powerful than facts when it comes to politics.

	• Bond. Elyria needs strong leaders — such as myself — if it is to remain the greatest power in the continent.

	• Flaw. I am bull-headed when someone refuses to see my point, and refuse to admit I'm wrong. I must always have the last word in any argument.

House Reed has strived for years to pave a clear path for one of their daughters to possibly become the next Divine Matriarch. Now, they have a promising prospect in the Lord Regent's daughter, High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed. Ophelia is currently attached to the Silver Order's deployment in Drakkenheim, and the Lord Regent hopes that should his daughter successfully aid in the purging of the city and bringing Lucretia Mathias to account, House Reed will be well positioned to take both the regency and the Divine Matriarchy in the years to come.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Claudia is a delicate noble woman in her mid-fifties. She has sunken features and a small, narrow face framed by flowing silver hair. She often wears a wide-brimmed brightly-colored hat and matching dress. She adorns herself with pearls, rings, jewels, and other finery. She speaks with a soothing, honeyed voice and often carries an air of elegance and false kindness.

	• Personality Trait. I present myself as a woman of importance, and speak from a position of power. One must know how to sound like a queen if one is to be treated as such.

	• Ideal. The House of Eden deserves to be the most powerful house in Elyria and so I represent it at all times as if it always has been, and always will be.

	• Bond. I must see the House of Eden rise to power again, and reclaim itself as the leading family of Elyria.

	• Flaw. I am quick to denounce the sins of others, but will never examine my own actions.

Claudia is desperately working on rebuilding her house's connections in Elyria. She would eventually like to see one of her daughters become Divine Matriarch, but none have mustered up the dedication and faith to become clerics of the Sacred Flame. In moments of fragile faith, she contemplates other magical means to get back the power she craves. In the meantime, she is working diligently to manipulate her way back on to the Cabinet. She talks sweetly to everyone she meets, but is just as likely to scheme against them if it means putting her family's name in a position of greater power in Elyria.

House Eden:
House Eden was once regarded as the most powerful family in Elyria. Over the past century, three separate Divine Matriarchs have been members of House Eden, at least a dozen High Flamekeepers, and two Lords Regents. If any has come close to establishing a new monarchical line in Elyria, it has been House Eden. However, their fortunes fell considerably after the assassination of Divine Matriarch Courage IX, who had been a scion of their household.
	Outwardly, the house holds deeply fundamentalist views regarding the Faith, and is zealous to the extreme. They believe their righteousness begets prosperity, and have used their position to funnel vast amounts of coin collected by the Faith into their family vaults. Their methods have never crossed the line of theft, however: instead, previous High Flamekeepers and Divine Matriarchs have openly gifted indulgences and land to the family as "blessings upon their faithful service" and other such contrivances. They use these funds to build lavish, castle-like cathedrals on their estates, filled with expensive art, sculpture, and gold decorations.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Gwenavere is the older sister of Divine Matriarch Mercy V. She is a wispy noble woman in her early fifties who often wears colorful gowns and opulent headdresses. She carries many symbols of the Sacred Flame at all times to present herself as a devout worshiper of the faith, though she could never muster up the patience and will to cast divine spells as a Flamekeeper. She is exceptionally proud to have her sister as the Divine Matriarch, and everyone in Elyria knows it. She holds the title of her kin over everyone's head and uses it as a justification for her to be treated as though she were royalty.

	• Personalty Trait. I take every opportunity to mention my sister, her importance to the nation of Elyria, and in turn express my own importance.

	• Ideal. Position, wealth, and power are all that matter in this world. If you can have your grip on all three there is nothing stopping you from achieving anything you want.

	• Bond. It's wonderful that my sister is the Divine Matriarch, but it means that our family will need to fight all the harder to hold on to everything we've gained.

	• Flaw. Though 1 was raised to follow the Sacred Flame from a young age, I don't care for the religion. I find the whole matter boring and tedious.

Gwenavere desires nothing more than to help maintain her family's newfound power, and grow her own importance within Elyria. She is a cunning and manipulative woman who will take any and every opportunity to undermine and deface anyone who speaks ill of the Divine Matriarch, and will use her public image to ruin anyone who attempts to get in the way of her family and their name.
	For all this, Mercy V does not get along well with her sister. The Divine Matriarch finds the way her sister flaunts her status arrogant and unpleasant, and Gwenavere herself finds her sister's great faith tiresome and overbearing.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.

    <description>Earl Orlando Timmins is a slight commoner man with goldyellow skin, well-dressed in a black-and-white silk tunic. He wears a heavy leather satchel overflowing with paper records and ledgers, and carries the Secretary General's Quill.

	• Personality Trait. I am soft-spoken, polite, and analytical, so others often ignore me. I keep my records with meticulous detail; nothing is unaccounted.

	• Ideal. I believe the Sacred Flame can lead us to progressive enlightenment, so long as our rulers do not keep us wallowing in the dark. We cannot forget how the Faith compels us to act with integrity and compassion in all things.

	• Bond. There are few moderate and open-minded leaders amongst our nobility today. We need such people to reverse Elyria's slow slide into theocracy.

	• Flaw. I hesitate to speak my mind or tell others uncomfortable truths, as I fear their anger, scorn, or retribution. My fears often cloud my reason.

The Secretary General is privy to all manner of sensitive information, so often the role is filled by a trustworthy and capable scion who lacks greater political ambitions. House Timmins is an Elyrian noble family known mostly for moneylending, but who have seldom been power-players in Elyria. Lord Regent Polonius Reed chose Orlando Timmins for this reason, but is quickly growing tired of the Earl's honest work.

Commoner:
Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.

    <description>Duchess Beatrice Atwood is a human noble in her late twenties. She has dark brown hair done up in a bun at the back of her head. Her face is sharp and angular with a thin nose, pointed chin, pursed lips and narrow eyes. She often wears a long gray skirt, a white blouse, and a black overcoat. She is a stern negotiator and exceptionally clever. She often dresses for her role as grand Ambassador, opting for neutral tones and smart fashion rather than anything overbearing or ostentatious.

	• Personality Trait. I am a forceful conversationalist and hardline negotiator. In an argument, I never let others get a word in edgewise. Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.

	• Ideal. Elyria is the greatest nation in the world. Our foes are envious of our mighty nation, and often hypocrites who seek one-sided concessions from us at every turn.

	• Bond. I have two young children. Recently, I have noticed strange occurrences and happenings around my estates, and I'm greatly concerned they might be mageborn.

	• Flaw. The other people of the world should think and act more like Elyrians, and we have little to learn from their faithless ways.

Beatrice has ruled Michael's Gate for the past six years. Previously she was in training to become a Silver Order paladin, and showed potential as both a cunning warrior, and clever diplomat. Now, with two young children to take care of, and the responsibility of ruling Michael's Gate, she has set aside her warrior days. Her new life of politics and leadership are no less fraught with conflict, however.
	Recently her two children have begun to cause strange sights and sounds around her home with no reasonable explanation. Beatrice is concerned they may be developing mageborn qualities. Terrified of facing this possibility, she has greatly ignored the signs and kept her concerns a secret. Unbeknownst to Duchess Atwood, the mages of the Amethyst Academy have already determined her toddlers are mageborn. Once they reach the age of six, the purple-robed mages will come to take them off to Paradox Castle.

	Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense.
	A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</text>

	• Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.

	• A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</text>

	• Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.

If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</text>

      <text>Blue dragons make their lairs in deserts and other arid landscapes. They prefer warm climates, but if an otherwise ideal potential lair presents itself in a cold environment, they find ways to adapt. Instead of seeking out lofty domiciles, blue dragons build their lairs underground, burrowing beneath sand or using magic to hew rock into an intricate warren of rooms and tunnels that can be expanded to accommodate a growing family. Still, they appreciate the tactical advantages of height and usually create their lairs near a spire or cliff from which they can keep watch over their territory.
	Though most blue dragons would be loath to the use the term themselves, their lairs are often surprisingly homey. They favor lairs that balance beauty and comfort and adorn them in soothing shades of blue, purple, and green.

      <text>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

	• Misleading Mirage: Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.

	• Sudden Sinkhole: The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.

	• Mirage Terrain: The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.

      <name>Blue Dragon Treasures</name>
      <text>Blue dragons have strict standards for what treasures they allow into their hoards and reject valuable objects that don't meet those standards. One blue dragon might keep only treasure that coordinates visually with the other items in the hoard, while another might focus on artwork from a particular period or seek out jewelry made for rulers in a certain region. Blue dragons' hoards are an enormous source of pride, and these dragons are insulted by offerings that don't meet their standards.
	Blue dragons favor blue, purple, and green gemstones; art depicting oases and fountains; and fine textiles in cool colors. They also love scents that evoke storms and rain, and magic items that produce weather effects.

Blue Dragon Art Objects:
d8 | Object
1 | An intricately carved seal from a civilization that worshiped the dragon's ancestors as gods
2 | An extensive collection of elaborate jewelry, including a tiara, tail rings, and claw covers, which the dragon wears when meeting with supplicants
3 | A set of sculptures depicting the dragon's deceased relatives, all adorned with ground-up jewels
4 | A jeweled mosaic map of the dragon's territory
5 | A glass bell that creates the sound of rainstorms and thunder for 1 hour when struck
6 | An ornately tooled tome recording the lineages of all the blue dragon families in the area

    <description>Greatest among the dragons of the Pale Tooth Mountains is Opularis the Wise, an ancient blue dragon. The scholarly dragon keeps a great library within the ruins of an ancient monastery. They are said to be the most welcoming of all the known dragons of the continent. Several grandmaster wizards of the Amethyst Academy meet Opularis for games of chess and afternoon tea, and once every century, the dragon takes on a mortal apprentice.
	However, Academy professors are quick to warn headstrong pupils about seeking the dragon's mentorship: Opularis does not teach amateurs, beginners, or raw talents. The dragon has been known to slay any would-be student who cannot impress them by casting three different spells of 6th level or higher.

Ancient Blue Dragon:
Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.
	A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.
	A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

Vain and Deadly: A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.
	A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant.
	When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.

Desert Predators: Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.
	When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

Overlords and Minions: Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.
	A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

Hoarders of Gems: Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.
	A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

    <description>Venus Joplin is an imposing woman in her late fifties. She has broad shoulders, a square face with defined features, and black pixie cut hair. She has almond shaped brown eyes and narrow lips. She wears a thick breastplate with open arms to accentuate her muscular strength. Her cape is emblazoned with the crest of her house, and she wears a circlet with a single sapphire gem placed in the center.

	• Personality Trait. I let my actions speak for me, and am a woman of few words. I know my house's worth, and I treat each Caspian as their house demands. Which means some I speak to as equals, and some I speak to as inferiors. Mostly inferiors.

	• Ideal. I am always the strongest and bravest person in the room. To say you are a great warrior is one thing, to be one takes guts.

	• Bond. House Joplin is the strongest Caspian house; the evidence is in the history books. I will hold the title of High King until I die, and on that day, my daughter will take my place.

	• Flaw. I do not care for the petty squabbles of my fellow houses. I am rude and demeaning to the other Caspian Houses when I feel they are not living up to my expectations of what a Caspian house should be, which is basically always.

Venus has held tightly to the role of High King for nearly three decades, and does not plan on relinquishing her title at the next Kingsmoot. Although she is well-loved by her people, and spoken of highly in tales and songs of her incredible victories, great monster hunts, and amazing arena duels, the other houses often dislike her, or are intimidated by her. She often enjoys this fact and revels in being the greatest Caspian warrior since Rex himself.

House Joplin:
House Joplin is considered the foremost amongst the Great Houses, having won the Kingsmoot seventeen times since it was established. The head of the household, Venus Joplin II, sits upon the throne in the Tower of Swords as the High King. She has ruled in this position for over thirty years, while the Joplin estates are looked after by her daughter, Magellan Joplin. They proudly boast the largest army, featuring large regiments of halberd wielding infantry. Their tactical combat acumen and polearm mastery is unmatched throughout Caspia.

Liege:
Many nobles of the great nations of the continent lead their own soldiers into battle, or set out on heroic adventures and diplomatic missions. Especially in the lands of Caspia, princes and princesses are more often than not trained and skilled combatants, looking to make their mark as a scion of their house.
