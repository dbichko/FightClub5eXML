        <name>Roguish Archetype: Smuggler</name>
        <text>Whenever someone has something of value, usually illegal, that they need delivered discreetly, they call a smuggler. These rogues are experts at concealing, stealing, and blending in unnoticed to the common folk. They are also uniquely skilled at turning opportunities around when things are not going their way, and using whatever means necessary to achieve their goals. These slippery rogues are crafty and cunning and should not be underestimated.

        <name>Pack Rat (Smuggler)</name>
        <text>Provided you have your hands free, you can retrieve and stow handheld items or weapons on your person as part of the action you use them (including the Attack action).

You have accumulated a collection of miscellaneous gear, which you conceal on your person for emergencies. This gear is kept in a bag, jacket, or backpack that you carry with you. You can retrieve any nonmagical, inanimate item detailed in the Adventuring Gear section of the Core Rules with a value of 25 gp or less and weighing less than 10 pounds. You may use this feature to retrieve a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Though otherwise functional, objects retrieved using this feature are visibly worthless junk.

        <name>Tricks of the Trade (Smuggler)</name>
        <text>You gain proficiency with the disguise kit, land vehicles, and water vehicles.

Whenever you make an ability check related to smuggling or concealing objects you add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

If you are driving a wagon, boat, or other vehicle with which you are proficient, you know tricks and modifications that you can make to build simple smuggler compartments in almost any vehicle. After one hour of work, you can conceal up to one quarter of the maximum carrying capacity of the vehicle at the Game Master's discretion. It takes one hour of work to modify a Large or smaller vehicle, eight hours to modify a huge vehicle, and two days to modify a Gargantuan or larger vehicle.

        <name>Never Tell Me the Odds (Smuggler)</name>
        <text>Sometimes when the odds seem against you is the exact right moment to pull a fast one on your foes, using the chaos to get in a vital strike.

You can still apply your Sneak Attack even when you have disadvantage on the attack roll, so long as you meet the other conditions for making a Sneak Attack.

        <name>Smuggled Spells (Smuggler)</name>
        <text>Beginning at 17th level, you can store spells cast by other creatures in your bag. Your bag can store up to 6 levels worth of spells at a time.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into your bag by touching the bag as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in your bag. If your bag can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

Alternatively, you can place a spell scroll in the bag. The spell is cast and stored in your bag and the spell scroll is destroyed. You can cast any spell stored in your bag. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the bag is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
