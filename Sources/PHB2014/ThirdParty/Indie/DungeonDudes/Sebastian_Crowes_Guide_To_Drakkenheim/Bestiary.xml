    <description>This floating mass of wet flabby flesh drifts through the air, its many long spindly tendrils dangling down like some form of incomprehensible jellyfish. Oftentimes these creatures appear in strange hues of pale pinks, purples, and whites. Their large eye placed in the middle of their fleshy mass glows with octarine hues and their gaze weakens the body and mind. The soft sound of thrumming and suckling follows them as insane chattering of unknown languages murmur in the minds of those unfortunate enough to behold these creatures that drift through the thin places into our world.

It ripples with black voidlike hues and splashes of deep purples and blues as if its flesh was a moving image of the cosmos.

    <description>These strange arachnid-like creatures seem to weave together partial realities, parallel dimensions, and alternate timelines like a spider spinning its web. They have features that resemble that of a large spider, but their twisted forms, elongated torso, fanged maws, and spiny hides give them an otherworldly guise that makes them hard to distinguish as anything from this plane of existence. Those who have faced one have commented on the broken sense of reality that occurs when attempting to attack an eldritch crawler.

On a failed save, a target takes 21 (6d6) acid damage and becomes restrained by the acidic goo until freed. The target can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free itself. A restrained creature takes 7 (2d6) acid damage if it ends its turn restrained by the goo.</text>

    <description>The maw vermin may have been a rat that fed on too much delerium, or perhaps the sickly scavengers of another dimension altogether. Its pink flesh is caked with thick patchwork tufts of fur, with three gangly long arms that end in long bony fingers with talon like claws. Rather than a head, the top of its massive body has two beady rodent-like eyes and rat-like features. Upon its belly is a large gaping maw filled with jagged teeth and a massive purple tongue slurping and slathering gobs of vile saliva out of it as it drags itself towards its next meal.

Donned in animal furs, wielding axes, and painting themselves with blood, these brutal warriors rage in to battle with an unrelenting ferocity. Many reavers believe they are closely tied to nature, the elements, and the wild animals of the places they inhabit. Whether it be the Netherwind Reavers, or the Northfolk from Skye, these terrifying warriors are infamous for their brutality.

    <description>Every monastery, chapel, cathedral, and shrine to the Sacred Flame is watched over by a Flamekeeper. These white-robed women guided by their faith are known throughout the nations to aid the downtrodden, protect the innocent, and perform religious ceremonies of many types. Occasionally Flamekeepers will join Silver Order knights on holy expeditions, or as envoys for the Sacred Flame, joining battlefields and wars as protectors, healers, and symbols of the Faith.

    <description>Not all mageborn are cut out for the rules, regulations, and intense study and practice required by the Amethyst Academy, and some do not make it through their schooling. An outcast may still be under the guidance of the Academy, performing field work or odd jobs that require a more hands on approach. Oftentimes these outcasts dabble in dangerous magics, and have far less caution, and far too much confidence for the Academy's liking.

    <description>The knights of the Silver Order are world renowned as the defenders of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Taking on holy quests and religious missions for the Divine Matriarch, these holy knights have been known to ride griffons into battle, or march forth in force armed with plate mail, swords, and shields, and divine magic to bolster their combat prowess. To some, these paladins have a reputation of being divine protectors, noble warriors, and divine symbols of the Faith. To others, they are a terrifying and ugly example of the power of the Sacred Flame.

    <description>Clad in rough hides and furs, these loud and gruff mercenaries have the distinct ability to change their forms and become animalistic bloodthirsty monsters. They have a dark reputation for their brutal fighting styles, complete lack of rules or honor, and animalistic nature. One thing is for sure: a Steelfang Mercenary knows how to get the job done, for the right price.

    <description>Although the term "ranger" has often been used to describe lone hunters on the fringes of society, or great groups of warriors from the jungles and forests, the Hooded Lanterns are renowned for their mastery of urban environments, military strategy, and skilled marksmanship. The talents and accuracy of the Hooded Lanterns has allowed them to survive and maintain a foothold in the ruins of Drakkenheim, arguably the most dangerous environment in the entire continent.

    <description>Inherited Silver:

Rickard Steelfang's unique curse means that normal silvered weapons are not effective against him. Instead, the weapon must be made specifically from silver that was passed down to the wielder from a now-deceased friend or family member. The weapon need not be in the original form the silver was inherited in. For example, a character could make silver arrowheads or crossbow bolts by melting down a silver locket given to them by their grandmother.

      <text>The dragon breathes a cone of prismatic rays. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 90-foot cone must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

1 The target takes 6d12 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

2 The target takes 6d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

3 The target takes 6d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

4 The target takes 6d12 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

5 The target takes 6d12 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

6 At the start of each of its turns, the affected target uses all its movement to move directly towards the closest creature it can see. Then, the affected target uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the affected target does nothing this turn. At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

7 At the start of each of its turns, the affected target gains 1 level of contamination. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

8 The target is struck by an additional ray. Roll on this table twice more. There's no limit to how many additional rays can strike a single creature in this manner.</text>

    <description>This extremely withdrawn Academy Director dwells on the moon. Although they typically interact with mortals in the guise of a human wizard, Amaranthyst is in fact an ancient delerium dragon. Indeed, the dragon's unique complexion of crystalline purple scales and gemstone-like features is the namesake of the Amethyst Academy itself.

Personality Trait. How do you know if you are the dreamer, or merely the dream? I speak in absurd paradox, asking mortals vexing questions to which they cannot answer within their limited reference frame.

Ideal. A single grain of sand makes no sound upon falling, but a million grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something. That is the nature of magic.

Bond. Mortals believe they can comprehend the fundamental forces of the universe, but they are gravely mistaken. If I know one thing, it is that even I know nothing.

Flaw. I find the fixed nature of the mortal world deeply strange. It is for the best that this world is unravelled by delerium, for chaos will only improve it.

Amaranthyst is order out of chaos incarnate. Aeons ago, the dragon entered the mortal plane from the Space Between Worlds, and has aided mortal mages out of curiosity and amusement. They have long sought to understand the unknowable properties of the strange dimension where it sprung into existence, and has spent millennia wandering that unfathomable place. Amaranthyst has long known about the secret properties of delerium, and views the crystals as merely the fundamental building block of reality itself. To them, the crystals are transforming the world into something wondrous, and he does not understand why mortals would fear it.

form which dwells in the Space Between Worlds. Perhaps it is the favoured cat of Phantasia, or a fragment of Shegorach, but to others, it is simply known by the odd name "Bruce".

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.
